Melonjan in Arad Battle Suit (ARAD SENKI) 0.0.5 (Incomplete Currently)

Thank you for downloading
A 3D reproduction of my CDNF summoner character, using VRoid Studio, and PMX Editor.
The name in the title is currently temporary. Actual name is not confirmed yet.
The avatars are based on Arad Battle Suit avatars that are first released in Arad Senki.

NOTE:
Do not move or delete the "tex" folder
There is uncleaned hair on the back side of the head.
Ponytail physics are not completed yet in this version. Setting gravity to zero is better.
I am currently not willing to design the weapon, arms, bunny ears (Blender is too hard to use lol).
